# ChessMaster
A simple chess game that works with chess san notations. You can place a human move like e7, or Nf3. This game is also equipped with two chess engines namely dev-zero and stockfish 9 for the learning process. The engines will search for the best possible move and then give it to you. The dev-zero engine was created by my creator. The stockfish 9 engine was created by Tord Romstad and his team. Sometimes the engine gives the wrong notation and therefore no move has been returned, therefore you must try once more and check your luck. There are seven user buttons. A user can use the tool ngrok and play with any other user in the world by just sending the link provided by the ngrok tool. This server was created by the flask platform. In a two-human game, a user needs to make a human move then wait and click on the receive human move to receive the move from the person playing from the other side of the world. The users must communicate before and discuss who will play black and who will play white correspondingly. For starters, you can make a human move by typing e7
